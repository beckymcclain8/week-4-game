# week-4-game

In this game the computer generates a random number.  There are four jewels, each representing a different random value.  The object of the game is for the user to click on these jewels until they match the random number generated by the computer.  The jewels' values are hidden until the user clicks on them.  The user must remember the value as it will not show on the screen.  The "score" will increase each time the user pushes a jewel button.  If the user is able to match the random number the game will record a win and start the game over.  If the user goes above the random number the game will record a loss and start the game over.  A new random number is generated at the beginning of every game and the jewels will each have a new random value as well.
